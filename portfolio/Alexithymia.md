## Alexithymia

This digital triptych portrays three women in stark black and white, their expressions distilled to raw, essential states of being. One weeps, one burns with anger, and one holds a smile — yet none are softened or hidden. Only their emotions are marked in vivid red, as if the intensity cannot be contained within grayscale. The work asks the viewer to sit with the complexity of feeling: how joy, grief, and rage coexist, how they resist language, and how they define our shared humanity beyond words.
