This piece portrays a woman whose face and body are traced with delicate golden cracks, inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi — the practice of repairing broken pottery with gold. Each fracture becomes a luminous path, symbolizing that healing does not erase the past, but transforms it into a source of strength and beauty. The calm expression on her face reflects the quiet resilience that emerges after hardship, while the gold glows as a testament to recovery, self-acceptance, and the courage to be whole again.
