This piece represents the experience of masking as an autistic person. On the surface, the figure appears composed, wearing a practiced expression that blends in with the world around them. But beneath that surface lies tension — the effort of hiding stimming, scripting conversations, and suppressing natural reactions. The artwork shows the contrast between the polished exterior and the inner self that longs to be free, revealing the exhaustion and fragility that masking creates. It captures both the strength it takes to perform this daily act and the quiet pain of not being fully seen.
